// recap that would otherwise show the surviving one as if nothing were lost.
//
// Levels carry the difference between the three findings, which are not the same fact:
//   - duplicated: a value the operator wrote is discarded by the loader's last-wins
//     rule, so it is a WARNING;
//   - absent: the binary carries the variable in its embedded template but the file
//     does not, which can only mean the configuration merge never ran, so it is a
//     WARNING too. An operator who has NOT upgraded runs an older binary with an older
//     template and sees nothing here;
//   - unknown: a variable the binary does not read. Nothing the operator wrote is lost
//     by the loader, it was never picked up in the first place, so it is INFO.
//
// The raw counters go to DEBUG BEFORE the operator-facing lines, because the audit
// knows the numbers before it renders them.
